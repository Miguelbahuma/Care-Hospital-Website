    <h1>THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT CARE HOSPITAL</h1>
     <p>
            The Streams of Life project was founded with a single goal: to treat, ensure good health and care for community. We believe that access to these basic resources is not a privilege, but a fundamental human right.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            We don't just treat people, we build lasting solutions. Our work focuses on three key areas:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Community hospitals:Installing reliable health resources, urbanization, and quality skilled health workers units.</li>
            <li>Health Education: Teaching proper health education and safe life living practices to promote good health.</li>
            <li>Local Partnership: Working directly with community leaders to ensure our services are sustainable and locally managed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Impact</h3>
